Hello here we will walk through steps which you need to perform indeed I performed while pushing my 1st PR to upstream project.

1. Create github account. Verify your Email & login to your account.

2. In search box on top left of github, search the project on which you wanted to submit the Pull Request.

3. After your project appears in searched items, click on It and go into Upstream Project's Home Page(1st Page).

4. Now you need to fork this project to create local copy for you.
  -> Click Fork, Top right corner on github.
  After project is forked, you can see your fav upstream project in your Repositories.
    Your Profile -> Project
5. Now its time to work on Linux console.

6. Open terminal on your local machine & type in following commands.
  Let upstream project name is test-proj.
  # yum install git -y
  
  # git clone https://github.com/<your-github-account>/test-proj
  
  # cd test-proj
  
  # git branch
  master       //We are on local master of our local clone
  
  # git checkout -b branch-1   //Lets create a branch inside master
  
  # git branch
    //Go the file/files which you want to change. And do the code change
    //Let you changed file1
    
# git diff
   You should see the file/files which you changed

# git log     //Lets check Log, See your PR is on top

# git add file1

# vim ./commit-message.txt      //Add commit message for your PR. This will help upstream committers to know what PR is about
   Hello This is commit message for PR1

# git commit -F /commit-message.txt

# git push origin branch-1       //Push your changes to branch-1 which we created earlier

7. Your work with Linux console is done. Go back to github.com > Your upstream Project. 
   Here you will see your PR is showing to be pushed to upstream.
   Click Preview, review the changes and Click Commit.
   
8. Go to upstream project's Pull Requests tab, you can see your PR on top of list.

9. Now owner of Upstream Project will review your PR, will provide comments/change requests to you. 
   You need to address them. We will discuss that in seperate thread.
   
Please getback in case of queries, other things.

Generate PR if you want to change anything here.
Thanks
